# Polymorph
Polymorph is a personal project I am making.
It is a creature collector inspired by Pokemon among other things. The scene is set across many dimensions, and the main character starts on Earth, but not quite how we know it.


## The Creatures
The creatures that are being collected are called *Polymorphs*.
Polymorph is an umbrella term for the three classes of Polymorph: [**Polymorph**](#polymorph-1), [**Monomorph**](#monomorph), and [**Nullimorph**](#nullimorph).


* ### Polymorph
    * A *Polymorph* is one of many variations across dimensions. This means there are similar designs across dimensions, which may or may not have the same types, colors, etc.
    This is the most common class of Polymorph.


* ### Monomorph
    * A *Monomorph* is a species exclusive to its resident dimension.
    This is a rarer class of Ploymorph.


* ### Nullimorph
    * A *Nullimorph* does not exist within any specific dimension, but between them.
    This is the rarest class of Polymorph.


### Types
Polymorphs also have different types. They have a primary type, based on where they spend the most time, and a secondary type, based on their combat style.

* #### Primary Type
    One of the following:
    * Terra
    * Aqua
    * Aero
    * Vacuus

* #### Secondary Type
    One of the following:
    * Physical
    * Elemental
    * Telekinetic
    * Spacio-Temporal (S.T.)

### Stats
Every Polymorph has the following stats (1-15)

* Attack
* Defense
* Speed
* HP

The stats are determined by the type of polymorph, not the individual example of the polymorph.


## Setting
The game is set across multiple dimensions, each with its own Polymorphs, terrain, and more!
Here is a tree containing the places in the game.
It is structured as follows:

Multiverse --> Dimension --> Region --> Important Buildings (if any)

* Multiverse
    * Dimension 001 / Earth
        * Home Town
            * Your House
            * School
        * Lab 001
            * The Lab
            * Portal 001
    * Dimension 002 / 
        * Test Grounds
            (Where you first arrive)
            * Portal 002
            * Portable Lab
        * ...
    * ...
